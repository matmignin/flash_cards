<h1>PATHO STUDY GUIDE TEST</h1><br><br>1. What does the membrane potential describe?<br>a. The charge inside compared to outside the cell<br><br>2. The membrane potential for cells in our body is negative or positive?<br>a. Negative<br><br>3. What are the substances that contribute to the difference in charge?<br>a. Positively charged ions outside the cell- Na<br>b. Positively charged ions inside the cell- K<br>c. Proteins and amino acids contribute a NET NEGATIVITY inside the cell<br><br> 4. The result of all ions and amino acids creates a ___________charge within the cell<br>a. Negative <br><br>5. Movement of substances is controlled _________ based on ___________ gradients<br>a. Passively, concentration <br><br>6. What two gradient types do Na and K have?<br>a. Concentration and electrical <br><br>7. In which direction is the concentration gradient for K pointed?<br>a. Out of the cell<br><br>8. Why?<br>a. Because there is a higher concentration within the cell, so K would move out if allowed<br><br>9. In which direction is the electrical gradient for K pointed?<br>a. Inside the cell<br><br>10. Why?<br>a. K is positively charged and the inside of the cell is negatively charged- opposites attract <br><br>11. What determines whether K will follow electrical or concentration gradient?	<br>a. Whichever is stronger<br><br>12. In which direction are the concentration and electrical gradients of Na pointed?<br>a. Into the cell<br><br>13. What is the equilibrium potential of K and how is it reached?<br>a. -90<br>b. Because the concentration gradient is stronger at -70, K will leave the cell. As it leaves, it takes its positive charge with it and the cell becomes more and more negative<br>c. As the cell becomes negative, the electrical gradient becomes stronger, and once it hits -90 and the K stops moving<br><br>14. When Na enters the cell, how does it reach its equilibrium potential?<br>a. As Na enters, it brings its positive charge with it, creating a more positive cell, and making the extra cellular space more negative. <br>b. Once it reaches +60, the electrical gradient and concentration gradient are equal and Na is at rest <br><br>15. What keeps Na from entering the cell freely?<br>a. Only lipid-soluble uncharged ions can cross freely <br>b. Na is water soluble, so it must have a channel to allow crossing <br><br>
