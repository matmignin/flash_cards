PATHO STUDY GUIDE TEST ONE1. What does the membrane potential describe?a. The charge inside compared to outside the cell2. The membrane potential for cells in our body is negative or positive?a. Negative3. What are the substances that contribute to the difference in charge?a. Positively charged ions outside the cell- Nab. Positively charged ions inside the cell- Kc. Proteins and amino acids contribute a NET NEGATIVITY inside the cell 4. The result of all ions and amino acids creates a ___________charge within the cella. Negative 5. Movement of substances is controlled _________ based on ___________ gradientsa. Passively, concentration 6. What two gradient types do Na and K have?a. Concentration and electrical 7. In which direction is the concentration gradient for K pointed?a. Out of the cell8. Why?a. Because there is a higher concentration within the cell, so K would move out if allowed9. In which direction is the electrical gradient for K pointed?a. Inside the cell10. Why?a. K is positively charged and the inside of the cell is negatively charged- opposites attract 11. What determines whether K will follow electrical or concentration gradient?	a. Whichever is stronger12. In which direction are the concentration and electrical gradients of Na pointed?a. Into the cell13. What is the equilibrium potential of K and how is it reached?a. -90b. Because the concentration gradient is stronger at -70, K will leave the cell. As it leaves, it takes its positive charge with it and the cell becomes more and more negativec. As the cell becomes negative, the electrical gradient becomes stronger, and once it hits -90 and the K stops moving14. When Na enters the cell, how does it reach its equilibrium potential?a. As Na enters, it brings its positive charge with it, creating a more positive cell, and making the extra cellular space more negative. b. Once it reaches +60, the electrical gradient and concentration gradient are equal and Na is at rest 15. What keeps Na from entering the cell freely?a. Only lipid-soluble uncharged ions can cross freely b. Na is water soluble, so it must have a channel to allow crossing
